# Drowsiness-Detection-TinyML-Project-

Long-distance travellers, particularly truck drivers, bus drivers, and taxi drivers, often face extended hours of driving, making them susceptible to sleep deprivation. The associated risks of fatigue and drowsiness can significantly compromise a driver's reaction time, attention, and overall ability to safely operate a vehicle. According to the National Safety Council (NSC), drowsy driving contributes to approximately 100,000 crashes, 71,000 injuries, and 1,550 fatalities annually. The prevalence of drowsy driving poses a substantial threat to road safety. The consequences of fatigue-related accidents underscore the urgent need for proactive measures to detect and mitigate driver drowsiness. 

In response to this challenge, we propose the development of a `Drowsiness Detection System` that leverages image processing and machine learning techniques to alert drivers when signs of fatigue become apparent.

Using Python libraries such as ***OpenCV*** for image processing and ***Keras*** for model development, the system will analyse facial features in real-time video feeds to detect instances where a person's eyes close, indicating potential drowsiness. Upon detection, the system will promptly notify the driver, providing a proactive approach to mitigate the risks associated with drowsy driving.
